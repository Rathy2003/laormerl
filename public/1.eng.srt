2
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:19,238
Quiet!

3
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:29,286
What are you?

4
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,205
Shh.

5
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:33,999
Oh.

6
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:49,230
Ahhh! You're a demon!

7
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:52,435
No, no. I'm not a demon.
I'm not a demon.

8
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:54,566
See? Just a guy.

9
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:56,782
Just a guy here to
rescue these dragons, so...

10
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,743
But you walked through fire!

11
00:01:58,744 --> 00:02:01,037
Dragon scales!
Dragons shed a lot.

12
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:03,122
No, I know a demon
when I see one.

13
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:04,749
No human legs are that skinny.

14
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,501
Think that's a good entrance?

15
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:08,878
Get a load of me.

16
00:02:11,423 --> 00:02:13,664
Aah! I knew it! More demons!

17
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:16,636
Ah, it's really just a nitwit who
forgot to fireproof his butt.

18
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:17,845
Hot, hot, hot, hot!

19
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:19,805
Guys, no, not yet!

20
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:21,098
Ahhh!

21
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:23,392
Behold,
your worst nightmare.

22
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:24,477
Behold.

23
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:26,729
Along with his sister,
who insisted on coming.

24
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,189
That's my intro?

25
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:31,150
Guys, too soon. You
always come in too soon.

26
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:35,488
Sorry, still getting
the hang of my wings.

27
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:37,229
Fishlegs, again with the baby?

28
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,784
This is a raid.

29
00:02:39,785 --> 00:02:41,494
I couldn't find a sitter.

30
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:43,531
Demons everywhere!
It's the end of the world!

31
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:47,458
Astrid.

32
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:49,377
I had him right where
I wanted him.

33
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:51,420
And now, he's right
where I wanted him.

34
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:52,672
Let's get to work.

35
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:54,382
Okay,
we screwed that up,

36
00:02:54,383 --> 00:02:56,339
but at least nobody else
knows we're here.

37
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:02,383
Easy, girl. It's okay.

38
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:05,267
Shh. We're gonna
get you out of here.

39
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:10,687
A Crimson Goregutter.

40
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:20,026
Look at this weirdo.
Bet it's super dumb.

41
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:23,869
Why can't I get this cage open?

42
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:24,950
It slides.

43
00:03:25,122 --> 00:03:26,914
Obviously.

44
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:27,998
Attack!

45
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:29,291
Get the rescues out of here!

46
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:30,748
Get that night fury!

47
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:35,756
Oh!

48
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:39,009
No running on the deck!
It's slippery. You could fall.

49
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,512
Step aside. Let me handle
the tough-guy stuff.

50
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:43,764
Huh? Whoa.

51
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:45,433
Oh.

52
00:03:45,434 --> 00:03:47,101
Yeah! That's two for me.

53
00:03:51,273 --> 00:03:53,357
Look out!
No, no, no!

54
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:54,894
Sorry.

55
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:01,859
Hal!

56
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:04,952
Thank you.

57
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:06,318
Now, go get the rest, bud.

58
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,083
I thought this was supposed
to be a stealth mission.

59
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,501
Yeah, they always
start that way.

60
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:13,992
Look out!

61
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:18,188
Thanks, Stormfly!

62
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:22,459
Oh, stop worrying.
They'll get it.

63
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:28,765
Eventually.

64
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,395
Move out! We've got 'em all.

65
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:33,481
I'm gonna headlock
every last one of you.

66
00:04:33,482 --> 00:04:35,894
I might even leg-lock you.

67
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,944
Amateurs!
I was just getting started.

68
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,856
Clear out, guys. Go, go!

69
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:46,858
Whoo!

70
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:49,205
Good hustle, boys.

71
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,786
Toothless, time to go!

72
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:00,542
Oh.

73
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:03,750
Hey, guys.

74
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:10,549
Ha-ha! You always
have my back, bud.

75
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:31,413
This is berk. Your new
home away from home.

76
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:34,998
A stunning, one-stop,
all-expense-paid dream destination.

77
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:39,624
So, settle in and
let your worries melt away.

78
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:48,719
And the locals are as
colorful as you get.

79
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:53,638
Any run-of-the-mill paradise
boasts beaches and sunshine.

80
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:58,556
Well, not us. We've got something
no one else can touch.

81
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:02,692
We, my friend, have dragons.

82
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:06,863
Lots and lots of dragons.

83
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:18,961
Gang, meet our latest Berkians.

84
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:22,954
Welcome to paradise, mate.

85
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:25,009
Well, aren't you a beauty.

86
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:27,303
Aw, you're welcome.
You're welcome.

87
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:30,556
I took on, like, 100 trappers.
1,000 trappers.

88
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:32,182
All with burning undies.

89
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:35,352
My thick, full beard
almost caught on fire.

90
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:37,396
Ugh, just... just stop.

91
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,273
So, uh, hiccup's mom,

92
00:06:39,274 --> 00:06:42,943
any notes on my bone-crushing assault
or was it pretty much perfect?

93
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:45,230
Oh, it was indescribable.

94
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:48,657
And please, call me Valka.
It has been a year.

95
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:50,242
First-name basis.

96
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:52,953
I think the real hero of
the day was toothless.

97
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:54,705
Isn't that right, bud?

98
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:57,499
What would we do without
you, oh king of dragons?

99
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,959
What would we do?

100
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,629
Well, we could train
a lot harder, for one.

101
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,297
That was pretty sloppy.

102
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:06,300
Astrid, uh,
does have a point.

103
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:09,678
Perhaps you all rely a little
bit too much on your dragons

104
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:12,264
and not enough on one another.

105
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:15,132
See? That's exactly what I was
saying. Just listen up, guys.

106
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:17,853
Yeah, your mom's
super-impressed with me.

107
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:19,515
I'm like the son
she always wanted.

108
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:22,191
Fishmeat.

109
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:23,602
You found a new friend.

110
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:28,854
Mind your heads! Whoa!

111
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:50,761
What good is having
the king of dragons around

112
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:52,221
if he can't keep the order?

113
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:54,929
Hey, bud, do you wanna
do something here?

114
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:04,400
And where do you suppose
we put these ones?

115
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:05,818
Eh, we'll make room.

116
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,059
Aah!

117
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:10,023
You brought back a Hobgobbler.

118
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:13,409
They're a bad omen.
We're cursed.

119
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:17,369
Nonsense.
What harm could he do?

120
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:21,417
No injuries. They're all a little
shaken, but otherwise healthy.

121
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:23,454
Now, who's hungry?

122
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:31,802
Point is, you can't keep
bringing dragons back here.

123
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:32,928
Aah!

124
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,013
Come on, boy.

125
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:35,597
You're just asking for trouble.

126
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:37,349
No, you don't, you little thief!

127
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,685
Those trappers are
getting closer by the day.

128
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:42,062
We can handle them.
We have the Alpha.

129
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:43,439
Ain't that right, bud?

130
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,271
Would you look at
how happy they are?

131
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:48,692
She's awesome.

132
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:51,321
Gobber, relax. We did it.

133
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:53,866
The world's first
dragon-viking utopia.

134
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:55,784
We made the dream a reality.

135
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:57,411
Your dream, maybe.

136
00:08:57,412 --> 00:08:59,079
Mine's less crowded and more...

137
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:02,416
...Sanitary.

138
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:05,500
Gobber, you're not fooling
anybody. I know you love them.

139
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:14,464
You're supposed to be the generation
that leads us into the future.

140
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:17,056
Ha-ha! Food fight!

141
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:20,350
Ooh, gorgeous.

142
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:22,019
Watch the hair! Good fishmeat.

143
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:26,982
Ugh! Thor help us.

144
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:29,735
Time to stop worrying
about problems out there...

145
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:31,111
Gobber... and start sorting out

146
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:32,488
the ones right here.

147
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:34,156
Okay, okay.
I'll think about it.

148
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:36,864
Hang up those saddles
and get married.

149
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:39,536
The "M" word.

150
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:41,413
Gross. Unless it's me.

151
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,918
Start ruling like
a proper royal couple.

152
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,294
Marry him, please.

153
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:49,922
You're the only one
with any sense around here.

154
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:52,257
With you wearing the pants,
there's still hope.

155
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:53,467
Wow! Gobber...

156
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:54,968
Not awkward at all.

157
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:58,806
Astrid, don't be like that.
Whoa.

158
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:00,766
That is a definitive no.

159
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:03,352
Look, if you need
a beard to cry on,

160
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:07,481
just lean on my shoulder, and you
can cry into my full, thick beard.

161
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:10,315
Oh, thank you,
tuffnut. Thank you.

162
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:12,475
So much.

163
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:14,446
Eret, son of Eret!

164
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:17,116
What's the report?

165
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:19,743
Two more trapper barges
spotted in the strait.

166
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:20,824
So we go after them.

167
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:22,704
What?

168
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:26,323
One day, you're gonna
pick a fight you can't win.

169
00:10:55,864 --> 00:10:56,944
Archers!

170
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,368
Deathgrippers.

171
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:34,433
The dragon riders attacked us
here, off the eastern strait.

172
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:38,697
Ragnar. Um, sorry.

173
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,313
My dear warlords.

174
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:44,116
How go your plans
to conquer the world?

175
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:49,666
Grimmel, my old friend.

176
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:50,876
Thank you for coming.

177
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:52,878
Oh!

178
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:55,547
A year since Drago's defeat,

179
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:59,384
and no further along with
your dragon army, I see.

180
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:02,137
You can thank the young
Chief of berk for that.

181
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:03,628
Stoick's boy?

182
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:05,098
Yuck!

183
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:07,184
He and his
peace-loving dragon riders

184
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:08,852
continue to raid our ships

185
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:10,969
and steal our dragons.

186
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:13,941
Mmm. That does
sound like a nuisance.

187
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:15,984
But I'm in the business
of killing dragons,

188
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:17,277
not retrieving them.

189
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:18,779
But, grimmel...

190
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:21,531
That idiot boy has done
all of the work for you,

191
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:25,327
gathering the dragons in
one place. Why bother me?

192
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:29,492
Because the flock is
protected by a night fury.

193
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:34,409
Not possible.

194
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:38,079
It seems one
slipped through your fingers.

195
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:42,261
Look, berk's dragons
will follow the Alpha,

196
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:44,846
so we'll pay you to capture him

197
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:47,429
and bring the flock to us.

198
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:51,430
We even have
your favorite bait.

199
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:56,817
The only dragon they left
us from last night's raid.

200
00:12:56,818 --> 00:12:58,308
A female?

201
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:01,363
Hmm.

202
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:04,616
So, do we have a deal,
old friend?

203
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:10,445
Watch out!

204
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:21,341
When all is said and done,

205
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:24,709
this young Chief will
bring me the night fury.

206
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:30,299
They don't have a leader,
just a boy.

207
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:34,101
Hiccup.

208
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:39,432
This is berk, son.

209
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:42,188
It's our home.

210
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:48,024
It was the home of your grandparents,
and their grandparents before them.

211
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:51,452
And it's my job as Chief
to protect us, hiccup.

212
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:57,127
And one day, when you're all grown up,
that job will be passed on to you.

213
00:13:57,128 --> 00:13:58,462
Okay.

214
00:13:58,463 --> 00:14:03,332
And it's very important, son, because
out there, beyond the sunset,

215
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:06,463
lies the home of the dragons.

216
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,263
Wow!

217
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:12,934
Aye! Legends tell of ships
that sailed too close to it,

218
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:17,272
only to drop off the edge of the
world, never to be seen again.

219
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:20,692
But those sailors
who turned back

220
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:23,528
told tales of a great waterfall

221
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:26,896
and dragons guarding the
entrance to a hidden world.

222
00:14:27,158 --> 00:14:29,490
Whoa. Not just a nest, hiccup,

223
00:14:30,328 --> 00:14:33,161
but a land from which
all dragons come.

224
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:36,246
Even night furies?

225
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:38,499
Especially night furies.

226
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:41,961
Those are scary.
Don't you worry.

227
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:46,166
One day I'll find the hidden
world and seal it up,

228
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:51,345
so that people and dragons
will fight no more.

229
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:02,901
What?

230
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:06,196
Oh, all right.

231
00:15:06,197 --> 00:15:08,573
You do know it's not a
chew toy, don't you?

232
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,867
Is this what you want?
Oh, do you want this leg?

233
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:13,280
Do you want my leg?
Go get it.

234
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:27,415
Getting pretty good
at gliding on your own, bud.

235
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:41,815
Oh!

236
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:44,776
So this is where you come
to get away from gobber.

237
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:47,189
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

238
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:50,449
Ugh!

239
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:53,199
Well, he's right, you know.

240
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:57,289
Really?
You think you and I should...

241
00:15:57,290 --> 00:16:00,498
Oh, gods, no. We're nowhere
near ready for that.

242
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:02,669
No, that's... that's crazy.

243
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,831
I mean, he's right
about all of this.

244
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:09,551
It does seem like the
whole world knows about us now.

245
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:12,220
Yep. And the more dragons
we bring back here,

246
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:14,052
the bigger of a target
we become.

247
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:15,557
Ugh!

248
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:19,221
I just wish there was some way
to make them leave us alone.

249
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:21,302
There might be.

250
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:26,641
Dad used to talk
about an old mariners' myth

251
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:29,321
of a secret land at the
edge of the world,

252
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:31,483
where dragons live
totally out of reach.

253
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:35,577
Well, sailors
are known for tall tales.

254
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:36,953
True.

255
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:38,239
But what if it's real?

256
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:41,500
It could be the answer
to all of our problems.

257
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:43,001
How?

258
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,038
By moving the dragons there?

259
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:46,630
Uh-uh.

260
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:48,131
All of us.

261
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:49,132
Seriously?

262
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:52,591
And abandon our home
of seven generations?

263
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:56,045
The home your father left
you to protect.

264
00:16:57,433 --> 00:17:00,435
Uh... yeah, I think we need
a real solution, hiccup.

265
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:09,319
Well, we could just take Gobber's
advice and tie the knot.

266
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,321
That should fix everything.

267
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:14,366
But, hey, if you're having
doubts about yours truly,

268
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:16,743
I'm pretty sure
Snotlout's available.

269
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:18,860
He only has
eyes for your mom.

270
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,373
Oh!

271
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:22,958
Playing dirty now, huh?

272
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,167
You asked for it.

273
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:26,753
Looks like there might be
a wedding after all.

274
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:29,881
Oh, how dare you?
That is a low blow.

275
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,998
No, no, you are
not getting away.

276
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:35,220
Okay, okay,
you win, you win.

277
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:36,552
You always win.

278
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:39,140
You knew what
you were getting into.

279
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:41,132
Uh-huh. Right.

280
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:48,856
Uh, bud?

281
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:55,313
What... yeah, sure, don't
bother to wait for us.

282
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:49,972
Oh, my gods!

283
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:52,513
Uh, hiccup!

284
00:19:57,446 --> 00:20:00,313
Yeah, yeah, we're... we're
friends. No need to kill us.

285
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:22,343
Wow! Another night fury.

286
00:20:23,097 --> 00:20:24,758
No, not quite. It's more like a

287
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:27,590
bright fury. A light fury.

288
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:30,806
Yeah, yours is better, probably.

289
00:20:33,441 --> 00:20:34,858
What do
you mean, gone?

290
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:36,484
Vanished. Into thin air.

291
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:37,485
What do ya think?

292
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:40,613
Uh-uh. Stubbier ears.
No dorsal plates.

293
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:42,157
Okay. Got it.

294
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:43,489
What a night.

295
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,827
Bud, what's gotten into you?

296
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:48,114
What is all this
slobbering and panting?

297
00:20:49,707 --> 00:20:51,197
He's in love.

298
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:55,372
Trust me, relationships are
nothing but pain and misery.

299
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:57,999
What did I just say?

300
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:00,835
Am... am I not enough?

301
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:04,752
I think that's a no.

302
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:17,776
Something like this?

303
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:19,986
You know what? Just trace your
toothless card and make her white.

304
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:21,112
You could've led with that.

305
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:24,365
Can you believe it?
Toothless has a girlfriend.

306
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:26,106
I never took you for a romantic.

307
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:27,869
Like, ever.

308
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:29,829
But it's so sweet.

309
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,195
I mean, look.

310
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:42,550
Okay. That's just sad.
And weird.

311
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:44,427
Yeah, you better do something.

312
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:48,014
Seriously? I'd rather shovel
poop all day than watch that.

313
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:51,257
All right. Let's head back to the
woods and see if we can find her.

314
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:57,100
Ah, good idea. A little privacy.

315
00:21:57,274 --> 00:21:59,025
Uh... shh.

316
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:00,109
It's boy talk.

317
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:02,237
What? Come on, let's
go work this out.

318
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:04,656
So, you wanna get married.

319
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:05,740
Uh, no, actually.

320
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:07,575
Good news. I've been
to two weddings.

321
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:11,496
I crashed both, but none as
high profile as this one.

322
00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:14,374
Lots of pressure, judgment.
And not just by me.

323
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:16,709
Look, we talked about it.
We're not getting married.

324
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:19,462
Cold feet. I've seen it before.

325
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:21,749
Don't worry, little Hiccy.
I'm here.

326
00:22:23,092 --> 00:22:24,217
Wait, Hiccy?

327
00:22:24,218 --> 00:22:26,135
Now, I've seen the way
Astrid looks at you.

328
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:27,846
Everyone has. That doubt.

329
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:29,597
That not-so-subtle
disappointment.

330
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:31,516
That longing for something more

331
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:32,600
than you.

332
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:33,768
You need to focus
on being worthy.

333
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:36,479
I mean, she's a warrior
queen, for Thor's sake.

334
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,562
And you are neither.

335
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:40,567
But with me as your best man,

336
00:22:40,568 --> 00:22:42,527
your spirit guide, if you will,

337
00:22:42,528 --> 00:22:45,530
you'll learn to embrace
your inner viking.

338
00:22:45,531 --> 00:22:47,949
Show these naysayers,
of which there are many,

339
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:50,743
that you're more than
just a malnourished runt

340
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:53,997
with bad hair, strange teeth,
and a twig for a neck.

341
00:22:53,998 --> 00:22:56,416
You're... you're
really bad at pep talks.

342
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:58,908
Stop letting these insecurities
get the best of you.

343
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:02,338
Everyone's watching.
I mean, everyone.

344
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:04,632
You need to man up. Do as I do.

345
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:06,134
It'll be hard,

346
00:23:06,135 --> 00:23:07,218
but you have my word.

347
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:10,211
And until I break that
word, I won't give up!

348
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,307
Hey.

349
00:23:12,308 --> 00:23:15,184
Hey! What, am I
wasting my time here?

350
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:16,936
You see some shiny
thing in the woods...

351
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:17,937
Ooh, what is that?

352
00:23:28,699 --> 00:23:30,735
Toothless!

353
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:31,945
Don't move a muscle.

354
00:23:33,454 --> 00:23:34,454
Hey!

355
00:23:43,631 --> 00:23:45,214
Someone's here. Huh?

356
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:48,343
He managed to slip past our scouts
and lay a trap in the woods.

357
00:23:48,344 --> 00:23:50,011
It ruined boy talk.

358
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:53,296
Let me at him!
Slow down, gobber.

359
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:56,434
Let's get a search team on the
ground, scouts in the air.

360
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:58,394
Toothless and I
will fly the coastline.

361
00:23:58,395 --> 00:24:02,273
Yeah, I wouldn't advise taking
toothless anywhere, Chief.

362
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:04,014
I know this handiwork.

363
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:07,570
Grimmel the grisly.
Famous back where I'm from.

364
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:10,114
The smartest dragon hunter
I ever met.

365
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:12,283
Well, next to me, of course.

366
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:15,276
He can't be that smart.
He left his trap unmanned.

367
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:19,624
Nothing's accidental
when it comes to old grimmel.

368
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:21,334
He lives for the hunt.

369
00:24:21,335 --> 00:24:23,419
To get inside the mind
of his prey.

370
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,081
To control its every choice.

371
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:27,465
It's all a game to him.

372
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:29,467
Well, he doesn't know
who he's playing with.

373
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:31,254
Yeah. We've dealt
with his kind before.

374
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:33,381
Don't underestimate him, hiccup.

375
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:35,971
Mark my words. He'll be back.

376
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:38,014
Then we'll be waiting for him.

377
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:55,535
All right. All right,
come on, give me a clue here.

378
00:24:55,536 --> 00:24:56,776
Give me a clue, dad.

379
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:22,350
Oh, I hope you don't
mind if I help myself?

380
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:25,763
This is, mmm, quite good.

381
00:25:27,443 --> 00:25:29,360
That is impressive.

382
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:30,692
But let me finish my drink.

383
00:25:34,742 --> 00:25:36,198
Toothless!

384
00:25:38,829 --> 00:25:41,115
What did you do to him?

385
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:44,032
Eh, nothing that
he won't sleep off.

386
00:25:48,005 --> 00:25:50,965
May I? Chief hiccup. Hmm?

387
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:52,467
Do I say Chief...

388
00:25:52,468 --> 00:25:55,210
Or do I call you hiccup?
What do you prefer?

389
00:25:57,473 --> 00:26:01,182
You have no idea
who I am, do you?

390
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:03,853
Oh.

391
00:26:03,854 --> 00:26:06,022
Well, your father knew of me.

392
00:26:06,023 --> 00:26:08,816
Now, there was a Chief.

393
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:12,560
One of the greatest dragon
hunters to have ever lived.

394
00:26:13,739 --> 00:26:15,946
What would he think of you?

395
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:21,245
He had it right, you know.

396
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:23,539
Making it his mission
to destroy the beasts,

397
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,451
so that you could
grow up in a better world.

398
00:26:26,043 --> 00:26:27,543
He changed his mind.

399
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:29,751
And look where that got him.

400
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:32,913
So, let's get to the point.

401
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:37,261
I am the night fury killer.

402
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:40,800
I've hunted every
last one but yours.

403
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:44,477
You are going to give me
that dragon, or I will...

404
00:26:44,478 --> 00:26:46,218
I will never give him up.

405
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:53,351
You wish dragons to live free
among us like equals?

406
00:26:54,655 --> 00:26:57,406
A toxic notion, my boy.

407
00:26:57,407 --> 00:27:01,119
History has shown that we
are the superior species.

408
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:04,954
What if word of your misguided
ideas were to spread?

409
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:11,585
It would be the undoing of
civilization as we know it.

410
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:13,916
Hmm.

411
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:20,127
Did we get him?

412
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:23,349
Now!

413
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:26,842
Sorry to barge in.

414
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:30,064
You think you can
come into my home,

415
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:33,933
sit in my father's chair,
and threaten my dragon?

416
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:36,028
This is berk.

417
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:40,199
And we have defended our way of
life from far worse than you.

418
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,409
Ooh.

419
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:44,328
A fighting spirit. I love it.

420
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:47,036
Only I'm afraid you're mistaken.

421
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:50,620
You've never seen
anything like me.

422
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:01,630
Astrid, look out!

423
00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:10,685
Look out! Son, get clear!

424
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:14,275
Run!

425
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:26,662
Have my dragon ready
when I return,

426
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:29,746
or I will destroy
everything you love.

427
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:44,430
Inside!

428
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:45,514
It's the middle
of the night!

429
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:46,641
What are we doing here?

430
00:28:46,642 --> 00:28:49,509
All right. All right, everybody.
Settle down, please.

431
00:28:51,355 --> 00:28:52,855
Fishlegs.

432
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:55,347
Have you ever seen that
species of dragon before?

433
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,403
Let me at him!

434
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:00,988
I'll give him
a piece of my mind!

435
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:02,980
And by mind, I mean fists!

436
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:06,827
Did you miss the part
where we almost died?

437
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:08,944
Have you seen my house?

438
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:11,832
This is a new kind of enemy.

439
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:14,710
And I underestimated him.
Now, that's on me.

440
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:16,201
But I will not do that again.

441
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:19,840
We're vikings!
We don't run from a fight.

442
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:22,093
At least, I don't. You might.

443
00:29:22,094 --> 00:29:23,636
I agree with hiccup.

444
00:29:23,637 --> 00:29:25,554
We haven't seen
the last of grimmel.

445
00:29:25,555 --> 00:29:26,973
He's a predator.

446
00:29:26,974 --> 00:29:28,557
Single-minded and patient.

447
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:30,643
He won't stop until he
gets what he wants.

448
00:29:30,644 --> 00:29:32,353
I'm with Eret.

449
00:29:32,354 --> 00:29:34,772
We have to take
this threat seriously.

450
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:36,816
Grimmel is just a sign
of the times.

451
00:29:36,817 --> 00:29:40,152
Our enemies are getting
smarter, more determined.

452
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:43,862
We're not just overcrowded.
We are exposed and vulnerable.

453
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:49,322
Short of full-blown war and risking
everyone we love, I don't...

454
00:29:51,415 --> 00:29:54,782
I don't see a way
of staying here any longer.

455
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:56,794
What would
stoick think of this?

456
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:59,081
Hey! Hear him out.

457
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:08,764
If we want to live in peace
with our dragons,

458
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:10,599
we need a better plan.

459
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,227
So what are you saying, Chief?

460
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:15,438
I'm saying,
we have to disappear.

461
00:30:15,439 --> 00:30:16,679
Off the map.

462
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:20,651
Take the dragons to a place
where no one will find them.

463
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:22,653
And where might that be?

464
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:25,406
He's talking about a quest
for the hidden world.

465
00:30:25,407 --> 00:30:26,490
The hidden what?

466
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:28,993
Out to lunch. Yeah.

467
00:30:28,994 --> 00:30:31,787
My father was obsessed
with it when I was a boy.

468
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:36,578
He made notes and maps in search of
the ancestral home of all dragons,

469
00:30:37,127 --> 00:30:39,539
tucked away somewhere
beyond the edge of the world.

470
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:42,295
It may be the solution we need.

471
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,710
We are dragon people.

472
00:30:45,344 --> 00:30:47,209
It's where we belong.

473
00:30:47,387 --> 00:30:49,548
Look, I know this is our home.

474
00:30:51,475 --> 00:30:53,932
My father left me to protect it.

475
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:57,181
But berk is more
than this place.

476
00:30:57,773 --> 00:31:01,317
We are berk.
The people, the dragons.

477
00:31:01,318 --> 00:31:03,934
I say berk is wherever we go.

478
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:08,821
I'm with him! Who else?

479
00:31:28,929 --> 00:31:30,971
Excuse me.
Coming through.

480
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:32,765
Let me just get
right through here.

481
00:31:32,766 --> 00:31:35,132
Fishmeat, look, eat your rocks.
Eat your rocks!

482
00:31:36,103 --> 00:31:39,105
Gods! People who fly with
babies are the worst.

483
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:43,859
I feel like I'm always asking
you this question, but...

484
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,986
Whoa! Wake up, grump. Wake up!

485
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:48,155
Is there an actual plan or...

486
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:51,325
Just keep flying until we
reach the end of the world.

487
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:53,112
Ah. Seems sensible.

488
00:31:54,371 --> 00:31:56,664
So, where are they?

489
00:31:56,665 --> 00:31:58,582
Gone. Obviously.

490
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:00,751
The night fury escaped you?

491
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:03,003
Again? I encouraged it.

492
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:06,167
They've abandoned their
only defensible position.

493
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:09,545
Running scared with what
little they can carry.

494
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:12,138
It just keeps going.

495
00:32:12,139 --> 00:32:13,925
That's 'cause the world
is actually round.

496
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:16,517
The sun's round.
The moon's round.

497
00:32:16,518 --> 00:32:17,977
Stars are round.

498
00:32:17,978 --> 00:32:20,020
Even though they're
small and stupid.

499
00:32:21,231 --> 00:32:22,815
Right? Stars.

500
00:32:22,816 --> 00:32:24,984
Don't fret. They won't get far.

501
00:32:24,985 --> 00:32:27,317
The night fury is distracted.

502
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:31,029
I introduced him to your female.

503
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:33,909
Furies mate for life, you see.

504
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:37,079
What you picking up on, bud?

505
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:40,374
The light fury!

506
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:41,834
She's following us!

507
00:32:41,835 --> 00:32:42,950
Cool!

508
00:32:46,173 --> 00:32:49,133
Would ya look at that? Tuffnut:
Where'd she go? Is she made of sky?

509
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:52,007
Whoa,
hold up, toothless.

510
00:32:58,894 --> 00:33:00,885
Well, look who it is.

511
00:33:01,021 --> 00:33:02,271
Uh.

512
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:06,025
Oh, hey, it's really
nice to finally...

513
00:33:06,026 --> 00:33:07,732
Ahh!

514
00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:17,530
This is perfect.

515
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:20,122
So great.

516
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:21,363
Not a word.

517
00:33:24,628 --> 00:33:27,254
Yes, yes. But where did they go?

518
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:29,298
I have to explain this.

519
00:33:29,299 --> 00:33:32,801
Night furies can't survive in the
cold, so they haven't gone north.

520
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:35,346
They're trying to put distance
between themselves

521
00:33:35,347 --> 00:33:37,338
and enemies
to the east and south.

522
00:33:38,058 --> 00:33:41,971
And night furies cannot fly
long distances without rest.

523
00:33:42,938 --> 00:33:46,106
Their flight path
must include stops.

524
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:47,313
Potty break!

525
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:52,026
Therefore,
they've gone...

526
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:56,773
They can only have gone...

527
00:33:58,954 --> 00:34:00,740
Does anyone
want to take a guess?

528
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:03,405
Anyone?

529
00:34:06,211 --> 00:34:07,962
Ah, east!

530
00:34:07,963 --> 00:34:09,213
West.

531
00:34:09,214 --> 00:34:10,589
Hmm?

532
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,330
Simple, you see?

533
00:34:12,509 --> 00:34:14,510
Oh, isn't this fun?

534
00:34:14,511 --> 00:34:16,502
Yes? No?

535
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:20,599
Yes. Yes.

536
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,102
Where is your love of the hunt?

537
00:34:23,103 --> 00:34:25,437
I thought you were conquerors.

538
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:27,731
You'll have your prize in time.

539
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:31,941
Just allow me a few more
days to enjoy this.

540
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:35,114
I have dearly missed it.

541
00:34:35,115 --> 00:34:36,240
All right.

542
00:34:36,241 --> 00:34:38,409
Looks like we're camping
here for tonight.

543
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:40,661
Well, thank Thor for that!

544
00:34:40,662 --> 00:34:44,164
Yes! My own place.
I plan to build a hut.

545
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:45,749
Only for the bearded.

546
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,668
Ruffnut, you got to stay out.

547
00:34:47,669 --> 00:34:49,378
Chin whiskers don't count.

548
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:52,673
I see a tower of
manliness in the shape of me.

549
00:34:52,674 --> 00:34:56,135
It's gonna be taller than Eret
with bigger muscles.

550
00:34:56,136 --> 00:34:57,386
Wha... what?

551
00:34:57,387 --> 00:34:58,470
Get outta my house!

552
00:34:58,471 --> 00:35:00,556
Hey! Is there a problem here?

553
00:35:00,557 --> 00:35:02,016
Yeah, there's a problem.

554
00:35:02,017 --> 00:35:04,226
Ever since you showed up, you've
been trying to upstage me.

555
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:06,645
You're just so jealous.
It's delusional.

556
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:08,522
Yeah, delusion's
a good word for it.

557
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:09,857
Listen, son of Eret.

558
00:35:09,858 --> 00:35:12,526
When hiccup blows it as
Chief, I'm next in line.

559
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:15,070
Number two, 'cause I'm
clearly Valka's favorite.

560
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:17,403
So, you better start
showing me some respect.

561
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:20,659
Strange little man.

562
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:21,994
Ah, don't mind him.

563
00:35:21,995 --> 00:35:25,664
It's not your fault you have
the body of a Norse god.

564
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:27,583
I myself have the same problem.

565
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,919
This one's mine!
This one's mine!

566
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,380
Blacksmith's stall
goes right here.

567
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:34,381
Aah!

568
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:35,966
One, two,

569
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:38,260
three, four, five.
Where's...

570
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:39,511
Uh, okay.

571
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:41,930
Hold on, gang. I...
I said make camp.

572
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:43,015
Did you see them?

573
00:35:43,016 --> 00:35:45,100
Not build a new village.

574
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:46,810
Who died and made you Chief?

575
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:49,347
What? Ow!

576
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:54,234
Granted, this place is very nice,
but it's not the hidden world.

577
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:57,321
We don't even know
if this hidden world exists.

578
00:35:57,322 --> 00:35:59,323
Yeah. This place is real.

579
00:35:59,324 --> 00:36:00,407
Yeah!

580
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:04,870
Eh, there's nothing more stubborn
than a mob of tired, hungry vikings.

581
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:08,363
Well, I guess this can
work as a base in the meantime.

582
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:11,116
It's defensible. Hidden.

583
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,213
All right. You can stay.

584
00:36:14,214 --> 00:36:15,839
Say hello to new berk!

585
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,716
Yeah!
Let's get building, lads!

586
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:20,083
Until toothless and I
find the hidden world.

587
00:36:23,098 --> 00:36:24,264
Now, about that voice.

588
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:27,768
Can we lose the whole
honking goose thing?

589
00:36:27,769 --> 00:36:31,438
It's hard to imagine wedded bliss
with that going off every minute.

590
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:34,608
If you're going
to continue west,

591
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:37,069
I should head back to make
sure we weren't followed.

592
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:39,279
Great idea. I'll go
with you for protection.

593
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,614
No!

594
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:42,276
You're far too important here.

595
00:36:42,784 --> 00:36:43,784
Yeah.

596
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:46,985
Just be careful.

597
00:36:47,122 --> 00:36:49,164
Look at this place! It's amazing!
That's a nice rock.

598
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:50,249
What?

599
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:53,834
This plan to hide us
from the rest of the world...

600
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:59,299
Though... though I wish it were
possible, I fear it can't last, hiccup.

601
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,916
I mean, you know I tried
to do the same for years.

602
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:07,218
But greedy humans
always find a way.

603
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:09,059
I just...

604
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:11,555
I only ask that
you think about it.

605
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:17,443
Do you still
think I'm crazy or...

606
00:37:17,444 --> 00:37:22,030
Let's just say this
whole idea is very you.

607
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:25,523
Well, thanks for supporting
me last night. It meant a lot.

608
00:37:25,702 --> 00:37:27,818
Don't thank me yet.

609
00:37:28,455 --> 00:37:30,195
I just hope
you're right about this.

610
00:37:50,727 --> 00:37:52,978
Toothless! No, it's too early.

611
00:43:22,475 --> 00:43:24,557
Oh, now you can draw.

612
00:44:45,558 --> 00:44:47,642
Oh. Someone hasn't slept.

613
00:44:47,643 --> 00:44:50,937
Yeah. Well, that light fury won't
let me within a mile of her.

614
00:44:50,938 --> 00:44:52,814
And neither of us
will be getting any sleep

615
00:44:52,815 --> 00:44:55,431
or finding the hidden world
until toothless takes over.

616
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:57,103
Hey!

617
00:44:57,236 --> 00:44:59,352
What do you think of that?

618
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:01,615
Yeah.

619
00:45:01,616 --> 00:45:03,992
You tried this once before.
He didn't want it.

620
00:45:03,993 --> 00:45:07,370
Well, until now
he didn't have a reason to.

621
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:08,371
Right, bud?

622
00:45:16,797 --> 00:45:18,048
What?

623
00:45:18,049 --> 00:45:20,634
No, nothing. I'm...
I'm impressed.

624
00:45:20,635 --> 00:45:22,177
I mean, look at you.

625
00:45:22,178 --> 00:45:25,347
Embracing change.
I am proud of you.

626
00:45:25,348 --> 00:45:27,213
Well, he's my best bud.

627
00:45:27,767 --> 00:45:29,223
I want him to be happy.

628
00:45:30,019 --> 00:45:32,135
Eh, besides, it's just
until he brings her back.

629
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:38,568
All right.

630
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:40,230
Fire when ready. Oh!

631
00:45:46,202 --> 00:45:49,285
Well, I guess you know
the tail is fireproof.

632
00:45:49,956 --> 00:45:51,821
Okay, toothless.

633
00:45:51,958 --> 00:45:54,501
Okay, okay. Yes, I know.
I know.

634
00:45:54,502 --> 00:45:56,868
Shh! Okay, I know.

635
00:45:58,047 --> 00:45:59,172
Please, this is not helping.

636
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:00,298
Well, well, well.

637
00:46:00,299 --> 00:46:01,880
Someone's excited.

638
00:46:02,051 --> 00:46:04,511
He's fresh
off his first date.

639
00:46:04,512 --> 00:46:06,471
Now he's love crazed.

640
00:46:06,472 --> 00:46:08,723
Only we're the ones going crazy.

641
00:46:08,724 --> 00:46:11,351
The sooner he brings back
that light fury, the better.

642
00:46:11,352 --> 00:46:14,312
Yeah, but to do that,
he'll need to fly without me.

643
00:46:14,313 --> 00:46:16,850
So time to give this new
and improved baby a shot.

644
00:46:18,985 --> 00:46:21,852
Attaboy. Looking sharp,
toothless.

645
00:46:22,947 --> 00:46:24,312
So what do you think, bud?

646
00:46:25,366 --> 00:46:26,658
Bring her home.

647
00:46:26,659 --> 00:46:28,535
By
Sundown at the latest.

648
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:34,038
No, save it for your girlfriend.
Go on. Get out of here.

649
00:46:42,258 --> 00:46:43,258
It's okay.

650
00:47:41,275 --> 00:47:42,310
Watch out!

651
00:47:46,572 --> 00:47:47,857
Go, Cloudjumper!

652
00:51:00,266 --> 00:51:01,266
To the Chief.

653
00:51:02,768 --> 00:51:03,935
To the Chief!

654
00:51:03,936 --> 00:51:05,597
Aye! To our Chief.

655
00:51:06,063 --> 00:51:08,231
A chip off the old block.

656
00:51:08,232 --> 00:51:10,848
Okay, guys. Now, I'm
just getting sick.

657
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:12,524
Okay.

658
00:51:13,821 --> 00:51:16,656
Gotta say, I thought you
were well off your rocker,

659
00:51:16,657 --> 00:51:18,741
but this spot ain't half bad.

660
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:20,952
This was supposed to be
a temporary solution.

661
00:51:20,953 --> 00:51:25,071
It's unanimous. Everyone agrees
we've definitely traded up.

662
00:51:25,207 --> 00:51:27,493
Well done, Chief.

663
00:51:27,876 --> 00:51:29,294
What if the tail broke?

664
00:51:29,295 --> 00:51:32,463
What if grimmel found him?
What if he needs me?

665
00:51:32,464 --> 00:51:33,631
Would you relax?

666
00:51:33,632 --> 00:51:36,259
He's probably having
the time of his life.

667
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:38,094
How would I know?
She never comes around,

668
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:40,837
and when she does,
she's always rushing off.

669
00:51:41,432 --> 00:51:44,267
I'm saying, how... how do we
know if she's right for us?

670
00:51:44,268 --> 00:51:45,348
Us?

671
00:51:45,477 --> 00:51:48,438
You know what I mean.
She's so wild and skittish.

672
00:51:48,439 --> 00:51:49,772
I'm just gonna say it.

673
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:50,857
I don't trust her.

674
00:51:50,858 --> 00:51:53,234
Can't tame
'em all, hiccup.

675
00:51:53,235 --> 00:51:55,862
One day you'll have to
snip those apron strings

676
00:51:55,863 --> 00:51:57,979
and let toothless
stretch his wings.

677
00:51:58,532 --> 00:52:02,024
Reminds me of a talk I had
with stoick about you. Gah!

678
00:52:03,329 --> 00:52:04,865
Where do they keep coming from?

679
00:52:05,289 --> 00:52:07,826
Who? Those bloody Hobgobblers.

680
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:10,710
I swear they're popping up
faster than rabbits.

681
00:52:10,711 --> 00:52:12,292
I think they want to eat me.

682
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:14,839
Evidence would suggest
I'm tasty.

683
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:16,466
Hiccy, a moment?

684
00:52:16,467 --> 00:52:19,385
Listen, I've been
watching you walk.

685
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:21,422
Lose the limp. No one's
gonna marry that.

686
00:52:21,889 --> 00:52:23,139
I have a prosthetic leg.

687
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:24,223
So have I.

688
00:52:24,224 --> 00:52:25,600
And I have a parasitic twin,

689
00:52:25,601 --> 00:52:27,762
but you don't see me
limping around about it.

690
00:52:28,103 --> 00:52:30,063
Come on. Chin up, Hiccy.

691
00:52:30,064 --> 00:52:31,230
Puff out that chest.

692
00:52:31,231 --> 00:52:33,441
Move that butt to the left
a little bit.

693
00:52:41,659 --> 00:52:43,274
Mom, are you hurt?

694
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:44,619
What happened out there?

695
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:46,996
I don't know how,
but grimmel is tracking us.

696
00:52:46,997 --> 00:52:50,410
Ahh! This is all because
of the Hobgobblers.

697
00:52:50,584 --> 00:52:52,877
He has 100 ships, maybe more.

698
00:52:52,878 --> 00:52:55,540
With enough cages
for all of our dragons.

699
00:52:57,341 --> 00:52:59,092
If grimmel is leading them here,

700
00:52:59,093 --> 00:53:00,754
we have to take him
out of the mix.

701
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:03,510
Uh, and how would we do that?

702
00:53:03,639 --> 00:53:05,504
By going there to capture him.

703
00:53:05,641 --> 00:53:07,006
Capture him?

704
00:53:07,893 --> 00:53:09,633
I'm with him! Who else?

705
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:59,062
Okay, split up.
We'll be harder to catch.

706
00:54:00,195 --> 00:54:02,864
I was thinking we should
split up. Just because.

707
00:54:02,865 --> 00:54:04,196
I like
your instincts.

708
00:54:05,367 --> 00:54:06,367
What is this?

709
00:54:47,493 --> 00:54:48,493
Quiet!

710
00:54:49,244 --> 00:54:51,329
Where's your dragon
when you need him?

711
00:54:51,330 --> 00:54:53,070
Hmm, Chief?

712
00:54:53,624 --> 00:54:55,615
Must've forgotten all about you.

713
00:54:57,002 --> 00:55:01,464
First rule of the hunt, separate
the prey from its pack.

714
00:55:01,465 --> 00:55:05,208
You've just removed yourselves
from the equation.

715
00:55:05,385 --> 00:55:07,125
Why are you doing this?
Really?

716
00:55:07,596 --> 00:55:09,461
I didn't think you cared.

717
00:55:10,015 --> 00:55:14,227
Well, unlike you, when I was a
boy and I came upon a night fury,

718
00:55:14,228 --> 00:55:16,344
I killed it where it slept.

719
00:55:17,022 --> 00:55:20,981
That simple act of courage
made me a hero in my village.

720
00:55:21,485 --> 00:55:24,737
So I decided to kill
every last one,

721
00:55:24,738 --> 00:55:28,449
bringing real peace
to the people of this world.

722
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:31,869
Until you came along,
preaching that dragons

723
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:35,665
are something other than
thieves and murderers.

724
00:55:37,042 --> 00:55:40,375
That nonsense dies now.
Starting with you.

725
00:55:40,504 --> 00:55:42,745
But you have dragons of your own.

726
00:55:43,048 --> 00:55:44,288
These?

727
00:55:45,092 --> 00:55:46,968
They're dragon killers,

728
00:55:46,969 --> 00:55:50,137
drugged into obedience
with their own venom.

729
00:55:50,138 --> 00:55:53,516
Not even your precious Alpha
could control them.

730
00:55:53,517 --> 00:55:56,853
They serve me and only me.

731
00:55:56,854 --> 00:55:59,266
Allow me to demonstrate.

732
00:55:59,398 --> 00:56:00,683
Take cover!

733
00:56:05,362 --> 00:56:06,612
Split up!

734
00:56:13,704 --> 00:56:14,704
Whoa! Run!

735
00:56:34,516 --> 00:56:35,881
Up here.

736
00:56:51,575 --> 00:56:52,815
Hurry!

737
00:56:54,912 --> 00:56:56,243
Go, go, go!

738
00:56:59,041 --> 00:57:00,156
Hiccup!

739
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:08,542
Gotcha!
Go, Cloudjumper.

740
00:57:15,057 --> 00:57:16,515
Yeah!

741
00:57:16,516 --> 00:57:18,598
Our hero!

742
00:57:29,905 --> 00:57:31,155
Hmm.

743
00:57:31,156 --> 00:57:33,898
Ugh, he takes
that stupid baby everywhere.

744
00:57:39,623 --> 00:57:40,783
Thor almighty!

745
00:57:40,958 --> 00:57:42,744
Guess we won't be
needing this then, huh?

746
00:57:43,585 --> 00:57:45,378
I led us right into his trap.

747
00:57:45,379 --> 00:57:47,004
Yeah, nice work, Chief.

748
00:57:47,005 --> 00:57:48,211
Right, ruff?

749
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:49,799
Wait.

750
00:57:49,967 --> 00:57:51,377
Uh... where is ruffnut?

751
00:57:51,510 --> 00:57:53,171
We... we left her behind?

752
00:57:53,303 --> 00:57:55,346
How could you not
notice she was missing?

753
00:57:55,347 --> 00:57:57,008
You ride a two-headed dragon.

754
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:58,432
Oh, yeah.

755
00:57:58,433 --> 00:58:01,686
I feel like how ruffnut
is every day. Dumb.

756
00:58:01,687 --> 00:58:03,354
Odin be spanked!

757
00:58:03,355 --> 00:58:05,311
This just gets
better and better.

758
00:58:06,858 --> 00:58:09,520
I try to avoid looking at her.
It gives me acid reflux.

759
00:58:09,653 --> 00:58:12,321
Okay, guys,
just keep your helmets on.

760
00:58:12,322 --> 00:58:13,531
Toothless and I will find her.

761
00:58:13,532 --> 00:58:15,533
Toothless has
the light fury now.

762
00:58:15,534 --> 00:58:16,990
He's probably
not even coming back.

763
00:58:17,369 --> 00:58:18,452
What?

764
00:58:18,453 --> 00:58:20,538
You gave him his
freedom, hiccup.

765
00:58:20,539 --> 00:58:21,747
What were you expecting?

766
00:58:21,748 --> 00:58:24,000
I never thought he'd
stay away for good.

767
00:58:24,001 --> 00:58:26,037
I... I...

768
00:58:26,962 --> 00:58:29,795
Look, I'll figure it out.
I just need more time.

769
00:58:32,259 --> 00:58:34,921
He thinks he has to lead alone.

770
00:58:35,721 --> 00:58:37,805
Because his father had to.

771
00:58:37,806 --> 00:58:41,014
He doesn't realize the
strength you have together.

772
00:58:42,019 --> 00:58:43,894
Do you still believe in him?

773
00:58:43,895 --> 00:58:45,271
Of course.

774
00:58:45,272 --> 00:58:47,064
I wish he did.

775
00:58:47,065 --> 00:58:50,398
But he thinks he's nothing
without toothless.

776
00:58:51,653 --> 00:58:54,110
Then help him realize the truth.

777
00:58:58,994 --> 00:59:00,077
Get on. What?

778
00:59:00,078 --> 00:59:01,078
We're going to find him.

779
00:59:01,913 --> 00:59:02,913
Really?

780
00:59:05,042 --> 00:59:07,043
Everybody, stay put.

781
00:59:07,044 --> 00:59:09,410
We will get ruffnut back.
Don't worry.

782
00:59:09,796 --> 00:59:13,883
Worry? If they're stuck with ruffnut,
I'm more worried about them.

783
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:19,211
Why the long face?

784
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:21,557
I mean, mine's long,
but yours is really long.

785
00:59:21,558 --> 00:59:24,049
All face and no brain. Like
you got stretched at birth.

786
00:59:24,186 --> 00:59:25,603
Do you have a twin, too?

787
00:59:25,604 --> 00:59:27,469
Tuffnut took up all the
room in mom's belly.

788
00:59:27,606 --> 00:59:29,482
Otherwise I'd have a rounder
head and more brains.

789
00:59:29,483 --> 00:59:31,474
That's science.

790
00:59:31,902 --> 00:59:33,819
My braids are like
little zipplebacks. See?

791
00:59:35,989 --> 00:59:38,824
Even the mold spots look
like eyes. It's so cute.

792
00:59:38,825 --> 00:59:40,201
They even have little
horns and everything,

793
00:59:40,202 --> 00:59:41,285
just like barf and belch.

794
00:59:41,286 --> 00:59:44,205
Except me and barf can't stand belch,
so they're really just barfs.

795
00:59:44,206 --> 00:59:45,206
It's warm in here.

796
00:59:46,041 --> 00:59:47,666
I know what you're thinking.

797
00:59:47,667 --> 00:59:49,874
You've never had
a prisoner this hot.

798
00:59:51,046 --> 00:59:54,215
All the boys love me. Except Eret,
who totally lost his chance.

799
00:59:54,216 --> 00:59:56,759
That ship has sailed,
boy. Sorry.

800
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:59,970
And hiccup is practically married
to that round-head, Astrid.

801
00:59:59,971 --> 01:00:02,807
But snotlout and fishlegs,
they're basically my harem.

802
01:00:02,808 --> 01:00:04,683
I just can't
choose, you know?

803
01:00:04,684 --> 01:00:07,311
Snotlout's a beefcake, but
almost too pretty, you know?

804
01:00:07,312 --> 01:00:09,897
Sometimes I think he's more
in love with himself than me.

805
01:00:09,898 --> 01:00:12,605
There's only room for one
beauty in this relationship.

806
01:00:12,776 --> 01:00:14,860
Fishlegs would
keep me alive longer

807
01:00:14,861 --> 01:00:17,488
if I had to eat one of them,
stranded on some glacier somewhere.

808
01:00:17,489 --> 01:00:19,198
But he never shuts up
about dragons.

809
01:00:19,199 --> 01:00:20,533
Don't you hate when people
never stop talking?

810
01:00:20,534 --> 01:00:22,240
Yes, I do. They just
keep going and going.

811
01:00:22,369 --> 01:00:24,610
Blah, blah, blah.
It's so boring.

812
01:00:24,746 --> 01:00:26,789
Can't we just feed her to
your dragons? I'm hungry.

813
01:00:26,790 --> 01:00:28,082
Hey, what do you have
to eat around here?

814
01:00:28,083 --> 01:00:29,625
I'm allergic to fish.
You should know that.

815
01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:32,333
That's all they have
at that stupid new island.

816
01:00:33,130 --> 01:00:34,336
Do you have any clams?

817
01:00:34,464 --> 01:00:36,215
They're like little mouths
with slimy food inside

818
01:00:36,216 --> 01:00:38,336
that's already chewed, like
the way mom used to do it.

819
01:00:38,802 --> 01:00:39,837
Enough!

820
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:43,973
Until I turned 12 and she was
like, "chew your own food."

821
01:00:43,974 --> 01:00:45,599
And I was like,
"no, I kinda like it."

822
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:48,269
Most annoying creature
ever to cross my path.

823
01:00:48,270 --> 01:00:49,760
Aw.

824
01:00:50,897 --> 01:00:53,315
Oops, you let the dragons out.

825
01:00:53,316 --> 01:00:54,900
I'm gonna get you.
I'm gonna get you.

826
01:00:54,901 --> 01:00:55,985
No, this one's gonna get you.

827
01:00:55,986 --> 01:00:57,317
Get...

828
01:00:57,571 --> 01:00:59,238
Take him and go!

829
01:00:59,239 --> 01:01:02,032
Please. I beg you.

830
01:01:02,033 --> 01:01:04,577
The deathgrippers
will have to forgo dinner.

831
01:01:04,578 --> 01:01:07,570
Ew! You feed
your dragons dragons?

832
01:01:07,706 --> 01:01:08,706
Go!

833
01:01:08,832 --> 01:01:10,823
Where's your bathroom?
I got to...

834
01:01:11,209 --> 01:01:12,209
Okay!

835
01:01:12,335 --> 01:01:14,461
Gods, no wonder
you have gray hair.

836
01:01:16,506 --> 01:01:18,507
Stress is not good for you.

837
01:01:20,427 --> 01:01:22,634
So long, losers!

838
01:01:32,063 --> 01:01:33,230
Where...
Where is she heading?

839
01:01:33,231 --> 01:01:36,473
She's tracking something.
Aren't you, girl?

840
01:01:36,651 --> 01:01:39,484
There's nothing but
miles and miles of...

841
01:02:12,103 --> 01:02:13,312
A great waterfall.

842
01:02:13,313 --> 01:02:15,064
At the end of the world.

843
01:02:17,651 --> 01:02:18,891
Stormfly!

844
01:03:15,208 --> 01:03:16,869
Wow.

845
01:03:17,627 --> 01:03:18,958
Look.

846
01:03:53,580 --> 01:03:55,411
Wow.

847
01:04:35,372 --> 01:04:37,328
It really does exist.

848
01:04:55,225 --> 01:04:56,308
Toothless.

849
01:04:56,309 --> 01:04:57,890
Shh. You'll spook them.

850
01:05:40,979 --> 01:05:42,594
Now that's a king.

851
01:06:25,356 --> 01:06:27,347
We should go.

852
01:06:27,567 --> 01:06:28,773
Oh, no! Oh, no!

853
01:06:39,704 --> 01:06:40,944
Stormfly.

854
01:06:58,598 --> 01:07:00,088
Go! Go!

855
01:07:11,903 --> 01:07:13,612
I... I'm sorry, bud.
I... I just...

856
01:07:38,805 --> 01:07:39,965
Son.

857
01:07:42,100 --> 01:07:43,306
You should be asleep.

858
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:45,800
I was thirsty.

859
01:07:49,357 --> 01:07:50,597
Yeah, come here.

860
01:08:02,912 --> 01:08:04,246
Dad?

861
01:08:04,247 --> 01:08:07,489
Are you gonna get us a new mom?

862
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:12,671
I don't want another.

863
01:08:12,672 --> 01:08:16,039
Your mom was
the only woman for me.

864
01:08:17,051 --> 01:08:19,463
She was the love of my life.

865
01:08:21,514 --> 01:08:25,052
But with love comes loss, son.

866
01:08:25,852 --> 01:08:27,477
It's part of the deal.

867
01:08:27,478 --> 01:08:30,390
Sometimes it hurts,
but, in the end,

868
01:08:31,316 --> 01:08:33,147
it's all worth it.

869
01:08:35,111 --> 01:08:38,274
There's no greater gift
than love.

870
01:09:20,823 --> 01:09:22,313
It's okay, bud.

871
01:09:23,201 --> 01:09:25,943
You belong there, with her.

872
01:09:27,330 --> 01:09:28,490
We don't.

873
01:09:31,709 --> 01:09:33,574
And that's all right.

874
01:09:34,379 --> 01:09:36,713
We'll find a way to...

875
01:09:45,973 --> 01:09:47,224
Hey!

876
01:09:49,268 --> 01:09:51,429
She followed us back.

877
01:09:56,401 --> 01:09:59,017
We might not have
to say goodbye after all.

878
01:10:06,369 --> 01:10:07,734
That's it.

879
01:10:07,870 --> 01:10:09,705
Whoo-hoo!
Yeah!

880
01:10:09,706 --> 01:10:11,446
Ruffnut? Miss me?

881
01:10:11,582 --> 01:10:13,072
How did you escape?

882
01:10:13,209 --> 01:10:14,699
I annoyed them
till they let me go.

883
01:10:14,836 --> 01:10:16,461
Wait. Wait.

884
01:10:16,462 --> 01:10:18,088
Grimmel let you go?

885
01:10:18,089 --> 01:10:19,420
So dumb.

886
01:10:19,549 --> 01:10:21,414
They couldn't handle me.

887
01:10:21,551 --> 01:10:23,593
See, everyone thinks Tuffnut's
more annoying, but...

888
01:10:23,594 --> 01:10:25,929
But... hold on. Ruffnut, focus.

889
01:10:25,930 --> 01:10:27,636
Were you followed?

890
01:10:27,765 --> 01:10:29,721
I never look back, hiccup.

891
01:10:29,934 --> 01:10:31,845
Toothless!

892
01:10:33,771 --> 01:10:36,513
Toothless!

893
01:10:45,533 --> 01:10:47,273
Toothless, come back!

894
01:10:55,835 --> 01:10:57,200
No!!

895
01:11:14,187 --> 01:11:18,430
And now our little game
must come to an end.

896
01:11:22,945 --> 01:11:24,606
Call them off, Alpha.

897
01:11:24,781 --> 01:11:27,443
No reason for her to die too.

898
01:11:41,255 --> 01:11:42,255
What are they doing?

899
01:11:42,381 --> 01:11:43,757
They could totally take him.

900
01:11:43,758 --> 01:11:45,589
Not with her life on the line.

901
01:11:49,055 --> 01:11:50,555
Save your breath.

902
01:11:50,556 --> 01:11:53,719
The only Alpha
they respond to is me.

903
01:11:58,981 --> 01:12:00,562
Aw.

904
01:12:00,775 --> 01:12:04,069
Don't feel too badly.
You tried your best.

905
01:12:04,070 --> 01:12:08,359
But you are nothing
without your dragon.

906
01:12:24,215 --> 01:12:25,546
Toothless!

907
01:12:42,984 --> 01:12:46,653
Oh, that is just Great.
Now what?

908
01:12:46,654 --> 01:12:49,771
I think it's time for number
two to become number one.

909
01:12:49,949 --> 01:12:51,655
He'll listen to you.

910
01:12:57,039 --> 01:12:59,075
Don't say it. I wasn't going to.

911
01:12:59,208 --> 01:13:00,834
I shouldn't have
dragged you out there.

912
01:13:00,835 --> 01:13:03,545
He wouldn't have flown me back.
She wouldn't have followed.

913
01:13:03,546 --> 01:13:05,130
Yep.

914
01:13:05,131 --> 01:13:08,133
I feel like the same screw-up
I was before I met toothless.

915
01:13:08,134 --> 01:13:09,718
I can see that.

916
01:13:09,719 --> 01:13:12,012
Are you just gonna stand there
and agree with everything?

917
01:13:12,013 --> 01:13:13,013
Well, you're right.

918
01:13:13,556 --> 01:13:15,765
You're back to
where you started,

919
01:13:15,766 --> 01:13:18,393
but I was the first
to believe in you.

920
01:13:18,394 --> 01:13:22,439
And I have watched you doubt
whether you're worthy ever since.

921
01:13:22,440 --> 01:13:24,190
But you know what?

922
01:13:24,191 --> 01:13:27,986
I am the person I am today
because of you.

923
01:13:27,987 --> 01:13:30,945
I never told you that,
but it's true.

924
01:13:31,115 --> 01:13:35,118
You are the bravest, most
stubborn, most determined

925
01:13:35,119 --> 01:13:37,621
knucklehead I know.

926
01:13:37,622 --> 01:13:39,908
Toothless didn't
give you that, hiccup.

927
01:13:40,499 --> 01:13:41,750
He just made it...

928
01:13:41,751 --> 01:13:43,287
Easier.

929
01:13:43,461 --> 01:13:45,668
And now it's gonna
be a lot harder.

930
01:13:46,881 --> 01:13:50,339
So, what are you
gonna do about it?

931
01:13:51,469 --> 01:13:53,050
Probably something stupid.

932
01:13:53,846 --> 01:13:55,802
That's the hiccup I know.

933
01:13:58,768 --> 01:13:59,848
Suit up, gang.

934
01:14:00,478 --> 01:14:01,718
We're going to get them back.

935
01:14:02,188 --> 01:14:03,271
What?

936
01:14:03,272 --> 01:14:04,940
He's lost his mind.

937
01:14:04,941 --> 01:14:07,853
Now that's marriage material.

938
01:14:08,027 --> 01:14:11,488
At last, faithful pupil,
you are ready.

939
01:14:11,489 --> 01:14:12,864
Um...

940
01:14:12,865 --> 01:14:16,357
How are we gonna get our
dragons back without dragons?

941
01:14:16,535 --> 01:14:17,615
Trust me.

942
01:14:21,499 --> 01:14:23,239
Watch yourselves.

943
01:14:25,544 --> 01:14:26,579
Move it.

944
01:14:29,715 --> 01:14:33,833
Um, that's right, Alpha.
No surprises.

945
01:14:42,895 --> 01:14:46,523
So, jump off the cliff

946
01:14:46,524 --> 01:14:48,024
in these.

947
01:14:48,025 --> 01:14:49,310
That's the best you've got?

948
01:14:49,443 --> 01:14:52,570
No, you guys
are the best I've got.

949
01:14:52,571 --> 01:14:54,232
Aw.

950
01:14:54,615 --> 01:14:56,282
I'm with him! Who else?
I'm with...

951
01:14:56,283 --> 01:14:58,159
Ruffnut, that was my line.

952
01:14:58,160 --> 01:14:59,160
Let's go!

953
01:14:59,328 --> 01:15:00,495
Try to keep up!

954
01:15:04,458 --> 01:15:05,959
Yeah! Whoo-hoo-hoo! Yeah!

955
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:07,252
I'm doing it!

956
01:15:19,098 --> 01:15:20,804
Aw.

957
01:15:21,100 --> 01:15:24,183
You didn't think I'd actually
hand you the night fury, did you?

958
01:15:24,311 --> 01:15:26,104
He's mine to kill.

959
01:15:26,105 --> 01:15:27,561
That snake.

960
01:15:27,690 --> 01:15:30,859
I intend to finish
what I started.

961
01:15:30,860 --> 01:15:34,603
Best of luck controlling them
without an Alpha.

962
01:15:34,739 --> 01:15:36,339
Hold on, toothless!

963
01:15:42,079 --> 01:15:43,371
Let go!

964
01:15:43,372 --> 01:15:44,789
Could've used some practice.

965
01:15:44,790 --> 01:15:46,791
I should've
skipped breakfast.

966
01:15:58,345 --> 01:16:00,301
Toothless!

967
01:16:19,658 --> 01:16:20,864
Perfect timing.

968
01:16:23,913 --> 01:16:24,996
Game faces.

969
01:16:24,997 --> 01:16:27,373
Yeah, what are you
waiting for? Get in there.

970
01:16:28,459 --> 01:16:31,246
Yeah! Take that!

971
01:17:11,001 --> 01:17:12,460
Heads up!

972
01:17:12,461 --> 01:17:13,621
Thanks.

973
01:17:13,754 --> 01:17:15,338
Look out!

974
01:17:17,842 --> 01:17:18,842
Thanks.

975
01:17:44,910 --> 01:17:46,901
I'm coming, toothless!

976
01:17:47,788 --> 01:17:50,200
You still think
he cares about you?

977
01:17:52,835 --> 01:17:55,793
Let's just see who he follows.

978
01:18:07,808 --> 01:18:10,345
I'm sorry, bud. For everything.

979
01:18:28,913 --> 01:18:30,699
Now let's go get her.

980
01:18:34,084 --> 01:18:35,627
Whoo-hoo!

981
01:18:35,628 --> 01:18:36,878
Yeah!

982
01:18:36,879 --> 01:18:38,004
Number two coming through.

983
01:18:38,005 --> 01:18:39,586
Surprise.

984
01:18:39,715 --> 01:18:41,049
Sorry about that.

985
01:18:41,050 --> 01:18:42,836
Come on.

986
01:18:45,304 --> 01:18:47,295
One more free.
Four to go.

987
01:18:50,434 --> 01:18:51,719
Try to keep up.

988
01:18:52,394 --> 01:18:53,686
I got your backs.

989
01:18:53,687 --> 01:18:55,021
Out of the way!

990
01:18:56,398 --> 01:18:58,980
Yeah, it's almost like
we're a team.

991
01:19:02,655 --> 01:19:05,317
You brought a baby to a battle.

992
01:19:05,491 --> 01:19:08,073
Uh-uh-uh. I wouldn't
do that if I were you.

993
01:19:18,921 --> 01:19:20,502
I love that dragon.

994
01:19:25,552 --> 01:19:27,762
Sorry we're late for the party.

995
01:19:27,763 --> 01:19:29,549
You're right on time.

996
01:19:39,233 --> 01:19:41,269
That's it. That's it.

997
01:19:52,246 --> 01:19:53,788
How are we
gonna get him off her back

998
01:19:53,789 --> 01:19:54,789
without hurting her?

999
01:19:54,915 --> 01:19:57,156
Fear the facial hair!

1000
01:20:06,260 --> 01:20:08,717
Oh, I have missed this.
Me, too.

1001
01:20:10,180 --> 01:20:11,260
See that there?

1002
01:20:11,724 --> 01:20:13,339
Aw, cute.

1003
01:20:13,475 --> 01:20:15,977
That's a bad omen.
You're cursed.

1004
01:20:22,484 --> 01:20:23,894
Yes! Go on!

1005
01:20:24,069 --> 01:20:26,151
Good on you!

1006
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:28,771
I guess you're not so
bad after all.

1007
01:20:35,456 --> 01:20:36,696
Hal

1008
01:20:51,305 --> 01:20:52,305
Abandon ship!

1009
01:20:52,639 --> 01:20:54,095
Whoa!

1010
01:20:55,225 --> 01:20:56,260
Ahhh!

1011
01:21:01,690 --> 01:21:02,857
Yay!

1012
01:21:02,858 --> 01:21:05,224
Yeah! Whoo-hoo!

1013
01:21:11,825 --> 01:21:14,032
Uh, we've got problems.

1014
01:21:28,801 --> 01:21:31,588
Take him down, hiccup!

1015
01:21:40,687 --> 01:21:43,349
We need a better plan,
and quick.

1016
01:21:47,861 --> 01:21:49,977
I got a... wait!
What are you doing?

1017
01:21:50,197 --> 01:21:53,314
Okay. Okay.

1018
01:22:19,184 --> 01:22:20,640
You'll kill both of us.

1019
01:22:21,437 --> 01:22:22,973
Fighting over a dragon.

1020
01:22:23,147 --> 01:22:24,353
That's your plan?

1021
01:22:27,734 --> 01:22:28,940
This is.

1022
01:22:33,323 --> 01:22:34,483
Save him.

1023
01:23:12,696 --> 01:23:13,936
No!!

1024
01:23:19,745 --> 01:23:22,828
See? I knew you'd come around.

1025
01:23:43,727 --> 01:23:44,727
Yeah!

1026
01:23:59,117 --> 01:24:01,452
Hey. Good morning, bud.

1027
01:24:02,955 --> 01:24:04,536
Here you go.

1028
01:24:05,457 --> 01:24:07,698
Boy, you're full of surprises.

1029
01:24:10,921 --> 01:24:12,661
He's all yours.

1030
01:24:24,017 --> 01:24:26,394
You know, Eret may be
blessed with brawn,

1031
01:24:26,395 --> 01:24:30,565
but, just between us,
you have the brains.

1032
01:24:30,566 --> 01:24:32,056
Number one.

1033
01:25:04,683 --> 01:25:07,299
You're right, bud. It's time.

1034
01:25:09,146 --> 01:25:13,858
I was so busy fighting for
a world that I wanted,

1035
01:25:13,859 --> 01:25:16,976
I didn't think about
what you needed.

1036
01:25:20,824 --> 01:25:23,618
You've looked after us
for long enough.

1037
01:25:23,619 --> 01:25:25,860
Time to look after yourselves.

1038
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:41,048
Oh, Stormfly,

1039
01:25:41,637 --> 01:25:42,752
my good girl.

1040
01:25:42,888 --> 01:25:44,128
All right, grumpy.

1041
01:25:45,223 --> 01:25:46,429
Off you go.

1042
01:25:47,351 --> 01:25:50,394
So long, you big ugly beast.

1043
01:25:50,395 --> 01:25:51,430
I'll miss you.

1044
01:26:00,322 --> 01:26:02,859
Oh, Cloudjumper. Oh.

1045
01:26:12,084 --> 01:26:13,668
Go on, bud.

1046
01:26:13,669 --> 01:26:15,878
Lead them to the hidden world.

1047
01:26:17,798 --> 01:26:20,005
You'll be safe there.

1048
01:26:20,759 --> 01:26:23,386
Safer than you could
ever be with me.

1049
01:26:24,721 --> 01:26:26,347
It's okay.

1050
01:26:26,348 --> 01:26:28,213
I love you too. And I
want you to be free.

1051
01:26:32,646 --> 01:26:34,682
Our world doesn't deserve you.

1052
01:26:35,148 --> 01:26:36,148
Yet.

1053
01:26:47,703 --> 01:26:49,409
Go, toothless.

1054
01:26:51,248 --> 01:26:52,248
Go.

1055
01:29:19,771 --> 01:29:21,432
To the
Chief and Chieftess!

1056
01:29:21,565 --> 01:29:23,146
Yeah!

1057
01:29:24,943 --> 01:29:26,193
Good on you.

1058
01:29:26,194 --> 01:29:29,857
Come, cry into
my full, thick beard.

1059
01:29:30,115 --> 01:29:32,857
It's so beautiful!
Gross.

1060
01:29:34,202 --> 01:29:36,287
Okay, you win.

1061
01:29:36,288 --> 01:29:38,529
I like sensitive guys.

1062
01:29:38,707 --> 01:29:40,708
I thought
it would never happen.

1063
01:29:40,709 --> 01:29:42,040
Finally, right?

1064
01:30:12,574 --> 01:30:15,409
There were dragons
when I was a boy.

1065
01:30:17,954 --> 01:30:20,497
Ah, there were great,
grim sky dragons

1066
01:30:20,498 --> 01:30:24,161
that nested on the clifftops
like gigantic, scary birds.

1067
01:30:25,545 --> 01:30:27,588
Little brown Scuttly dragons

1068
01:30:27,589 --> 01:30:31,800
that hunted down the mice and
rats in well-organized packs.

1069
01:30:31,801 --> 01:30:34,637
Preposterously huge sea dragons

1070
01:30:34,638 --> 01:30:38,347
that were 20 times as big
as the big blue whale.

1071
01:30:39,309 --> 01:30:41,560
Some say they crawled back
into the sea,

1072
01:30:41,561 --> 01:30:45,270
leaving not a bone nor a fang
for men to remember them by.

1073
01:30:46,650 --> 01:30:49,983
Others say they were nothing
but folktales to begin with.

1074
01:30:51,071 --> 01:30:53,528
I don't know,
I'm okay with that.

1075
01:31:14,302 --> 01:31:15,678
Hey.

1076
01:31:15,679 --> 01:31:17,340
Hey there, bud.

1077
01:31:25,146 --> 01:31:26,261
Remember me?

1078
01:31:28,608 --> 01:31:30,348
It's okay.

1079
01:31:40,286 --> 01:31:43,778
Hey, I am glad to see you
too, bud.

1080
01:31:43,915 --> 01:31:46,327
He's not gonna eat your father.

1081
01:31:46,459 --> 01:31:50,122
Hey! How's the tail holding up?

1082
01:31:50,255 --> 01:31:52,047
Probably could use some oil
and a little fine-tuning.

1083
01:31:52,048 --> 01:31:54,835
Look, it's okay.
They're friends.

1084
01:31:58,221 --> 01:31:59,631
Come on.

1085
01:32:00,473 --> 01:32:01,633
Here.

1086
01:32:02,183 --> 01:32:03,642
Go on. It's all right.

1087
01:32:03,643 --> 01:32:04,883
Come.

1088
01:32:05,562 --> 01:32:07,302
He won't hurt you.

1089
01:32:07,814 --> 01:32:10,897
Hold your hands out. Like this.

1090
01:32:11,985 --> 01:32:13,270
That's it.

1091
01:32:16,906 --> 01:32:18,817
Let him come to you.

1092
01:33:12,170 --> 01:33:13,205
Legend says

1093
01:33:13,338 --> 01:33:16,882
that when the ground quakes
or lava spews from the earth,

1094
01:33:16,883 --> 01:33:17,883
it's the dragons

1095
01:33:18,009 --> 01:33:20,796
letting us know
they're still here.

1096
01:33:22,055 --> 01:33:24,717
Waiting for us to figure
out how to get along.

1097
01:33:33,108 --> 01:33:36,026
Yes, the world believes
the dragons are gone,

1098
01:33:36,027 --> 01:33:38,313
if they ever existed at all.

1099
01:33:38,905 --> 01:33:41,817
But we Berkians,
we know otherwise.

1100
01:33:43,368 --> 01:33:46,405
And we'll guard this secret
until the time comes

1101
01:33:47,122 --> 01:33:50,865
when dragons
can return in peace.
